Our project will be implementing the “Kanban” structure as a methodology. We had in consideration other methodologies for implementation, but Kanban is a methodology that maximizes efficiency. 
Also, with Kanban you can visualize your tasks more easily, and you can improve your software continuously. 
This will allow us to ask the right questions sooner and get to the point faster. 

We are going to have group meetings once per week. 
The process goes as follows: we divide our work into small parts, and when we consider something is ready, we put a request in our Teams group and wait for everyone to make a comment. 
After all the members of the group agree, then a job can be considered done and we update our program. 
As per team, we should have less than 8 things “to do” in the Trello board, otherwise it goes into next week's task.
